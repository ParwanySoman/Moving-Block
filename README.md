- So first thing I did was make a container to put everything in it. So that means everything we add in our HTML comes under our container, so it can be IN it. 

- Then we make a variable in JS of the container

- Added background color for the container in css otherwise you can't see it. 

- How to have the container in the center of your page? Use first --> position: absolute; and make then the top and left 

- Then we need a square. So we go to our HTML and we make a div within: id="square"

- Then we go to our JS and make a variable of it. 

- Then we go to our CSS file and make the square. (you can choose how big or how small you want it)

- Now we need our square to move left, right, top, bottom. How do we do this?
